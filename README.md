MY NAME IS JOEL, I AM A CYBER SECURITY PRACTITIONER AND A RESEARCHER

Recently there have been many phishing campaigns and the UNITED NATIONS JOB RECRUITMENT SCUM dominates them at I write this article.

It is being shared in most whatsapp groups and other platforms to attract a large number of unemployed youths wishing to try their lack of getting jobs. The scammers know many youths have smart phones, so they can easily fall for such a bait.

The link shared looks like this

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), originally known as the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946. It was created to provide emergency food and healthcare for children and mothers in countries devastated by World War II.

EXODUS OF THE SCAM

Given the link that looks like this https://cuts.ke/Unicef-Jobs-Recruitment-2023, it left me with very many questions.

The official UNICEF website is https://www.unicef.org/, why is the link shared https://cuts.ke

Where is the link redirecting us to?

What do we need to do once redirected?

What are we asked to give away?

What are we being asked to download or upload?

How legit is the process?

Given the experience I have in analyzing such cases let me dive in to answer these questions.

Clicking on the link (https://cuts.ke/Unicef-Jobs-Recruitment-202) we are redirected to the site https://recruitment.jobs-checker.xyz/,https://recruitment.jobs-checker.xyz/ which is slightly different from what we saw from the link shared, but is a recruitment portal that looks like this.

![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/02609b19-3ad3-4284-bb30-e73eaa63cef7)


This page has an application form that requires us to input our personal details, without signing up or logging in. However, the page has a sign-up or login button.

That's suspicious because why should a portal allow you to use its functions without signing up? Wowww

Let's go deep into that

My further analysis shows that the signup/login buttons are not responsive initially; they are not functional when you click them.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/0bb9a6cf-b2dc-4097-86a1-f73429ad87b4)

We can confirm that by checking the source code and seeing the code behind the buttons.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/84104f10-a7b1-4522-adcd-206d5f201332)

Those buttons don't let you navigate anywhere, which is a bit strange for a global organization like UNICEF's job recruitment portal.
Let me fill out the form with the details they ask for. However, I have to confirm something small before filling in the form
The submit button functionality, because I wish to know what happens after I submit my details to the portal.

That red button is the one I am talking about, because it can submit my details and to what destination.

Let's confirm that by checking the code behind the button.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/157cf1eb-54c0-4cae-9b50-649ea8d9ce3e)

The button just redirects us to another web page called step2.html, so the details we enter are not submitted. When we click on the APPLY button, we are redirected to another page

#Fill ing the form

That is how I filled the form with wrong details like incorrect phone number format and incorrect country. If the form was legit should have filtered out. Imagine the form accepts wrong details.
After pressing the Apply button, we were redirected to https://recruitment.jobs-checker.xyz/step2.html as we had seen earlier and the page looks like this.

Before clicking the green button, we must first check the code behind it.

I always get interested in Javascript code because it's the one that triggers the damage functionality.

The number of people registering keeps increasing every minute, but why does it increase but our details do not go anywhere?
This is the math behind the increments.

The link shared looks like this




Based on the above screenshot of a phishing link from a Whatsapp group, it appears that their target audience is 18-40, which is the age bracket of those who have smartphones and who are unemployed.

The scammers are very aware of their target since they want as many people as possible to fall for this as it indicates that it is a mass recruitment.



The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), originally known as the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946. It was created to provide emergency food and healthcare for children and mothers in countries devastated by World War II.

I always get interested in Javascript code because it's the one that triggers the damage functionality.


The number of people registering keeps increasing every minute, but why does it increase but our details do not go anywhere?

This is the math behind the increments.







Explanation of the code above.

The JavaScript code sets up a countdown timer that starts with a value of 4548 and decrements every second until it reaches zero. Let's break down the code:

Here's how the code works:

    The variable timeleft is initialized with a value of 4548. This represents the initial time remaining in the countdown.

    The setInterval function is called, which repeatedly executes the provided callback function at the specified interval (in this case, every 1000 milliseconds or 1 second).

    In the callback function, timeleft is incremented by a random value between 0 and 600 using Math.floor(Math.random() * 600). This random increment simulates time passage in an unpredictable manner.

    The content of the element with the id "countdowntimer" is updated with the current value of timeleft using document.getElementById('countdowntimer').textContent = timeleft;. This will display the updated countdown value on the webpage.

    The code checks if timeleft is less than or equal to zero. If it is, clearInterval(downloadTimer) is called, which stops the interval execution, effectively stopping the countdown.

Initially, the purpose of this is to fool the people that this is real time statistics of people applying for the job wowww clever catch to fool innocent people.

The same page has a comment, like and reply section where applicants confess that they have applied and others have been considered. My guess is that this is also just hard coded javascript to fool people.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/90af8ebb-01a8-48b4-a788-3167ec47419d)


This is the java script behind the like, share and comment section.

var time = 0; window.setInterval(function () { time = time + 1; $(".t1").html(time + 1 + "m"); $(".t2").html(time + 2 + "m"); $(".t3").html(time + 4 + "m"); }, 6e4); var likes = 134, comments = 23, shares = 12; window.setInterval(function () { likes = likes + Math.floor(Math.random() * 3); comments = comments + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); shares = shares + Math.floor(Math.random() * 2); $("#likes").html(likes + "K"); $("#comments").html(comments + "K comments"); $("#shares").html(shares + "K shares"); }, 5e3);

It sets up an interval function using setInterval() that runs every 60,000 milliseconds (1 minute). Inside this function, it increments the time variable by 1 and updates the HTML content of elements with the classes "t1", "t2", and "t3" to display the updated time values.

It defines variables likes, comments, and shares with initial values of 134, 23, and 12 respectively.

Another interval function is set up using setInterval() that runs every 5,000 milliseconds (5 seconds). Within this function, the likes, comments, and shares variables are updated by adding a random number to each. The HTML content of elements with the IDs "likes", "comments", and "shares" is then updated to reflect the updated values.

Initially the code does the magic of increamenting the likes and likes and shares but not the applicants as purported
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/ef879106-a838-4694-9b4e-c4db16898669)
As you can see the from the above screenshot, the comments on the web page are coded in the html hence we confirm that there is no user or applicant that comments.

So from the webpage we are told to continue.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/9ab25a0f-c6f2-4528-9e8b-95952fb8897b)

After clicking on the continue button we are redirected to a page that looks like this
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/45ce7633-2594-4107-9d15-e30c720e6191)

As usual same people with same comments haha what changes here is the likes,shares and time because it is increment as we saw by the js code above.

As usual same people with same comments haha what changes here is the likes,shares and time because it is increment as we saw by the js code above.On this webpage we are asked to validate our name and current level education aand a send button. To check the authenticity of this form i always put wrong syntax of inputs for example if am asked name i put a number as shown below.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/a31c1ccf-e0b7-4251-8aa9-d3df479e22a5)

This is  because I am aware that scammers motives are way far beyond what you input.

After clicking the send button, the portal accepts those details, proving to be a success.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/07b8d332-fd89-451c-89c8-37144e19ee61)

After clicking send button we are redirected to https://recruitment.jobs-checker.xyz/step2.html stills this page is interesting because its where the users are told to share this link to 5 whatsapp groups before they continue.

The page looks like this
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/dc7be9f2-ad3f-4d0f-bec9-292665074ea5)

Here the innocent user are enticed that they are qualified to work at UNICEF but at one condition first.
How to proceed:
1. Share it with 5 groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp (Click on the "SHARE" icon below).
2. You will be redirected automatically to our "APPOINTMENT FORM" page after the GREEN verification bar is filled.
3. You will receive a confirmation Email After Successful Application.
So in order for one to receive the appointment he has to fulfill the above haha wow, lets analyse the magic behind that share button.

So the instructions you can only be redirected automatically to their  "APPOINTMENT FORM" page after the GREEN verification bar is filled.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/dabc24b6-dbe9-4d21-8e35-cddb10733593)

So lets check the code to understand the basis of this.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/161a8404-afb5-474b-b19d-5de2f826e79a)


So the share button on line 854 has an id called whatsapp and this will ease our analysis as the id will be traced from the javascript code to get the functionality of the button.
The scammers were too wise that they decoded the javascript so as to make our lives hard to analyze, but i was able to decode and make the code readable as seen.
The code looked like this
document.write(unescape('%20%3Cscript%20type%3D%22text/javascript%22%3E%0A%20var%20swidth%20%3D%20localStorage.getItem%28saved%29%3B%0Aif%20%28swidth%20%21%3D%3D%20null%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20var%20width%20%3D%20swidth%20*%201%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%24%28%22%23intro%22%29.fadeOut%280%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%24%28%22.comments%22%29.fadeOut%280%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%24%28%22%23share%22%29.fadeIn%280%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%24%28%22%23fill2%22%29.css%28%22width%22%2C%20width%20+%20%22%25%22%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%24%28%22%23percentage2%22%29.text%28width%20+%20%22%25%22%29%3B%0A%7D%20else%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20var%20width%20%3D%200%3B%0A%7D%0A%24%28%22%23whatsapp%22%29.click%28function%20%28%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20window.location.href%20%3D%20share%3B%0A%20%20%20%20if%20%28width%20%3D%3D%200%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20width%20+%3D%2050%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%20else%20if%20%28width%20%3D%3D%2050%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20alert%28error%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20width%20+%3D%2015%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%20else%20if%20%28width%20%3D%3D%2065%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20width%20+%3D%205%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%20else%20if%20%28width%20%3D%3D%2070%29%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20
 Note: the code above is just a snippet of a larger code.
 
 After a good Time of research i released, the code seems to be encoded using the escape function, so it needs to be decoded before it can be understood properly. I was able to use an online tool for code decoding and beautifying.
And the code now looks like this.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/9e029141-c9a7-427c-9ed7-58426e6b8690)
So now i am able to read the code and anlyse it.

The code creates a script element dynamically using document.write and assigns it a type of "text/javascript". Inside the script, there are JavaScript statements. 

THE WHATSAPP ID
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/2ff27ae6-ffed-4611-b8b3-610e76e882dd)
Handling the click event on the element with the ID "whatsapp":
When clicked, it changes the window.location.href to the value of the share variable, which is a WhatsApp share link.
Depending on the current value of width, different conditions are checked, and the width variable is incremented accordingly.
If width reaches a specific value, it displays an alert with the content of the error variable.

After updating the width variable, it stores the updated value in the localStorage using the saved key.
After a delay of 2000 milliseconds, it updates the width and text of the element with the ID "fill2" and "percentage2" respectively.
When the element with ID "whatsapp" is clicked, the following actions are performed:

The window.location.href is set to the value of the share variable. This redirects the user to the specified URL.
The code then checks the value of the width variable using a series of if statements.

If width is equal to 0, it increments the width variable by 50.
If width is equal to 50, it displays an alert with the content of the error variable and increments the width variable by 15.
If width is equal to 65, it increments the width variable by 5.
If width is equal to 70, it displays an alert with the content of the error variable and increments the width variable by 10.
If width is equal to 80, it displays an alert with the content of the error variable and increments the width variable by 5.
If width is equal to 85, it increments the width variable by 2.
If width is equal to 87, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 88, it increments the width variable by 2.
If width is equal to 90, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 91, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 92, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 93, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 94, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 95, it increments the width variable by 1.
If width is equal to 96, it increments the width variable by 2.

From the above when the link is clicked it is thats how the sharing of the phishing link 5 times is being counted using the function above.
And the width is used to fill the bar as instructed.


WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE ABOVE LOGIC?
When the share button is clicked the functionality behind it generates an advert to be shared in the whatsapp group like the one we saw at the start.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/5e236eb1-96db-4fb6-a14e-415c76d9fc31)
This code assigns this text to value. This same text is the one being shared and when you check it well it has a typo
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/72d2820a-0e01-4a7c-a867-fff218161852)

The word UNICEF is misspelled and that's how illegitimate it is.
The generated text looks like this in the whatsapp with the UNICEF misspelled as UICEF
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/b42fdf96-b036-4441-bf2d-cedbacedcc11)
And how is the function counting the percentage and the time the user shared the link to 5 whatsapp groups or 15 friends on whatsapp.

HOW THE PERCENTAGE IS COUNTED TO KNOW HOW MANY TIMES HAS THE LINK BEEN SHARED.
The code:
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/b613cd2b-5751-4d87-9db5-2863a82fb6b5)

1. swidth: It retrieves the value stored in the localStorage object using the key "saved".
2. ![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/15a8ff7f-c5af-4c0b-a0b6-3f3c84ce37e3)
To comfirm this let me change the value to 100 in the local storage to see if the function will retrieve the value.
 Editing the value in the local storage.
 
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/657c9994-2cac-4185-8367-77fa5a899d0b)


Now let me refresh the page and check the percentage of the bar if it is 100%
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/39555cfa-f299-4076-b796-2b1ffb5529b7)

Innitally we have been able to escape the logic of sahring this link to innocent people in the course of anlysing.

And yess after refreshing the page bar is 100% hence it is true that just the function retrives the value in local storage unlike sharing the link 5 times in the whatsapp group.
The if statement checks if swidth is not null. If the value is present in localStorage, the following actions are performed:
The value of swidth is multiplied by 1 to convert it to a number and assign it to the variable width.
The element with the id "intro" is faded out (fadeOut(0)), making it invisible.
Elements with the class "comments" are faded out (fadeOut(0)), making them invisible.
The element with the id "share" is faded in (fadeIn(0)), making it visible.
The width of the element with the id "fill2" is set using CSS, based on the value of width.
The text content of the element with the id "percentage2" is set to the value of width plus the percentage symbol.
If swidth is null or not present in localStorage, the else block is executed, and width is set to 0.
At 100% we can be able to see the full bar
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/757dbe43-50d2-4d03-9a52-e755dc563d2f)

After bypassing the sharing of the phishing link we were now redirected to another page requiring us to certify ourselves again.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/4d09e07c-1893-43e9-ab05-258d86ef6eb4)

Let us see the functionality behind that button called VERIFY NOW but recall from the following code 
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/62d3f581-8077-4824-ac51-30d90908b4ef)


There is a link to be redirected to https://link.shangodo.xyz
share: It constructs a URL for sharing the text1 message on WhatsApp using the "whatsapp://send" protocol.  And the constructed message looks like this



This is the same message we see being assigned to the variable in the code below not forgetting the typo
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/5ca52fd6-e4d0-499c-9105-57b30e144ea5)

error: It contains a string message indicating that something is wrong with the posts and provides a possible reason for the issue for example 

abcde: It contains a string URL pointing to "https://link.shangodo.xyz". 

After laveraging all the functions we were redirected to the page 
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/a8aab942-6b34-453d-9c18-a236163ec5a9)

This page has a verify button which takes us to the https://link.shangodo.xyz 

On reaching that link were welcomed with a shopping site with wired url https://best.aliexpress.com/?aff_fcid=ce40bdbd60d149ab9ccecd0eaf3042ee-1684687908471-09645-_DekEWkD&tt=CPS_NORMAL&aff_fsk=_DekEWkD&aff_platform=portals-promotion&sk=_DekEWkD&aff_trace_key=ce40bdbd60d149ab9ccecd0eaf3042ee-1684687908471-09645-_DekEWkD&terminal_id=38bc9f9f674f47ccac2b87932128c160

This page on that url looks like this mimicking AIiEXpress
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/1cdd44ee-0382-4aa6-bd97-4499a3a5b913)

To my suprise every time you click the link https://link.shangodo.xyz  it redirects you to a new sight as seen now am not rredirected to Ali express
but to Gambling site that looks like this.
![image](https://github.com/khanzjob/unicef-scam/assets/84052314/9bb15f11-15e1-4c57-94a1-62c0f3a3d683)
 This means every person is redirected to a diffrent sights.
 
Malicious actors have different motives, some may require you to download malicious softwares and others may require you to visit malicious links and sites.

To my suprise the person that expected the job ended up on a site that sells products and betting sites or sites that have Adult content.

WHAT IS THIS KIND OF SCUM.
The scum name is called CLICKBAIT.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
 It involves creating misleading or sensational content with enticing headlines or promises to attract users to click on a link. When users click on the link, they are typically redirected to different websites that display advertisements.

Clickbait is often used to generate high click-through rates (CTR) and drive traffic to websites, which can result in increased ad revenue or affiliate marketing earnings for the creator. However, clickbait practices are generally considered deceptive and unethical, as they manipulate users' curiosity or interest to generate clicks without providing valuable or relevant content.

It's worth noting that many online platforms and advertising networks have policies in place to combat click fraud and clickbait practices. They employ algorithms and systems to detect suspicious click patterns and may penalize or ban accounts engaging in such activities.

The practice of clickbait or click fraud is related to the pay-per-click (PPC) model in online advertising. In a typical PPC model, advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. This model is commonly used in search engine advertising (such as Google AdWords) and other online advertising platforms.

Clickbait or click fraud can exploit the PPC model by artificially generating clicks on ads without genuine user interest or intent. This can be done through automated scripts, bots, or by incentivizing users to click on ads through deceptive means. The intention is to increase the number of clicks and drive up advertising costs for the targeted ad campaign.

Clickbait practices aim to manipulate the PPC model to generate revenue for the publisher or to sabotage competitors' ad campaigns. However, it is important to note that click fraud and clickbait are considered fraudulent activities and are strictly prohibited by advertising platforms and networks. Advertisers and platforms take measures to detect and prevent click fraud, such as using algorithms and monitoring click patterns to identify suspicious activity.

Hence some times a user can redirected to sites that may install malware to his/her device.

Initially its is a good idea not to click any links and basing on that oraganisations have their websites equiped with information that one can verify in order not to fall for such scums that may wreck havoc to you or your device.
